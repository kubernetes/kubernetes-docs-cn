**NOTICE:** This repo is being repurposed and will host the Kubernetes.io CNCF Chinese Translation Workforce project. Consequently, the contents of [k8smeetup/k8smeetup.github.io](https://github.com/k8smeetup/k8smeetup.github.io) will be moved here, and the previous contents of the `master` branch will be located in the [kubernetes-docs-cn-master-archive.zip](/kubernetes-docs-cn-master-archive.zip) file.

[翻译组工作流程（中文版）](README-CN.md)

The `release-1.1-cn` branch is still currently; however, it will be deprecated once the open issue and pull request authors have been properly notified and those issues/PRs have been closed.


The workflow for the CNCF Chinese Translation Workforce is documented here:

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xz7BhW8Qkh6reYU7S7RDzSov5e101Vz_fHjq-fEX-W4/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xz7BhW8Qkh6reYU7S7RDzSov5e101Vz_fHjq-fEX-W4/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs)

Changes are coordinated via the WeChat Group (for instant communication) and a worksheet, which includes the article index, work assignment, internal reviewer assignees and status, is tracking the progress:

## Instructions for Contributing to the Kubernetes Documentation

Welcome! We are very pleased you want to contribute to the Kubernetes documentation.

You can click the **Fork** button in the upper-right area of the screen to create a copy of this repository in your GitHub account called a *fork*. Make any changes you want in your fork, and when you are ready to send those changes to us, go to your fork and create a new pull request to let us know about it.

Once your pull request is created, a Kubernetes reviewer will take responsibility for providing clear, actionable feedback.  As the owner of the pull request, **it is your responsibility to modify your pull request to address the feedback that has been provided to you by the Kubernetes reviewer.**  Also note that you may end up having more than one Kubernetes reviewer provide you feedback or you may end up getting feedback from a Kubernetes reviewer that is different than the one originally assigned to provide you feedback. Furthermore, in some cases, one of your reviewers might ask for a technical review from a [Kubernetes tech reviewer](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/wiki/Tech-reviewers) when needed.  Reviewers will do their best to provide feedback in a timely fashion but response time can vary based on circumstances.
